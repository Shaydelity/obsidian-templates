# Shaydelity's Obsidian Templates

These are the templates I use regularly within my obsidian vault. I share them so that others may be able to take things from them for their own vaults and needs.

## Structure

1. Excalidraw: Folder of Templates for [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) (I have not yet made any, dunno if that will change).
2. Insertions: Folder of Templates meant to be inserted during the making of a document. Only has lists of contents for (german) analysis writing and similar from my school days currently. Will probably expanded soon-ish.
3. The common templates: Each template is designed to be used within certain folders, after which they are also named. They are not supposed to be manually invoked. I use the [Advanced New File](https://github.com/vanadium23/obsidian-advanced-new-file) plugin to always create files in the folders they are supposed to end up in, making all templating wholly automatic. They always start with a "T" for template which makes sure there won't occur any double file names within my vault. 

> The "T Note" template is the standard one used if none other is defined. The Anchor of Content template is not yet used and mostly a filler.
